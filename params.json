Vaaclipse uses the [vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) to move e4 to Web and provides eclipse based platform for building server side web applications.\r\n\r\n### About e4\r\n[E4](http://www.eclipse.org/e4/) is the future of the Eclipse Platform. E4 provides the great concepts thats helps you build modern modular and modeled applications. The platform design allows use different UI toolkits for GUI presentation. The appropriate GUI presentation layer is called **renderer**. Eclipse RCP applications (and Eclipse itselft) use the SWT renderer. Except SWT there are, forexample, JavaFX renderer by Thomas Schindl called [efxclipse](http://efxclipse.org) allowing you build eclipse applications using JavaFX (the modern java UI toolkit). The vaaclipse project provides you the [vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) renderer for [e4](http://www.eclipse.org/e4/) platform.\r\n\r\nThe e4 project description on eclipse.org: http://www.eclipse.org/e4/\r\n\r\nA lot of usefull publications and tutorials about e4 can be founded on www.vogella.com\r\n\r\n### About vaadin\r\n[Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) is the Java framework for building modern web applications. It does web development very easy. Together with e4 platform vaadin helps you to build next gen web applications in modular and modeled way.\r\n\r\n### About project state\r\nFirst milestone relize was relized 8 november.\r\n","tagline":"Vaaclipse - the vaadin renderer for Eclipse E4"}
