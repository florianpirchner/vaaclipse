{"name":"Vaaclipse","body":"### Project description.\r\nVaaclipse is the way to use the power of the [Eclipse e4](http://www.eclipse.org/e4/) platform in web applications development. Vaaclipse uses the [vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) to move e4 to Web and provides eclipse based platform for building server side web applications.\r\n\r\n### About e4\r\n[E4](http://www.eclipse.org/e4/) is the future of the Eclipse Platform. E4 provides the great concepts thats helps you build modern modular and modeled applications. The platform design allows use different UI toolkits for GUI presentation.

The vaaclipse project provides you the [vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) renderer for [e4](http://www.eclipse.org/e4/) platform.\r\n\r\nThe e4 project description on eclipse.org: http://www.eclipse.org/e4/\r\n\r\nA lot of usefull publications and tutorials about e4 can be founded on www.vogella.com\r\n\r\n### About vaadin\r\n[Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) is the Java framework for building modern web applications. It is do web development very easy. Together with e4 platform vaadin helps you to build next gen web applications in modular and modeled way.\r\n\r\n### About project state\r\nVaaclipse now is on final state of development. The first version is planned to be releazed at the end of october. Of cource, you can try the current version (it's work with some restcrictions) obtaining sources from github.
